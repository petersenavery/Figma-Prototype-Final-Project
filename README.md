# Figma Prototype Final Project
 Repository of prototype files, drafts, sketches, etc. for final project.

As you see, I changed my mind last minute. This week, I went back on my decision, and I decided to go with a Figma prototype.
I've been interested in working with this program more, and I think this project could serve as a nice portfolio piece. I don't think I have the emotional investment to write a thinkpiece, and I wouldn't be all there intellectually. 

 This repository consists of a .fig file containing the brief work I've done so far visualizing my paper prototypes, also found in this repository. I hope to develop a working version of all of my paper prototype papers, as well as improve upon the work I have done.
